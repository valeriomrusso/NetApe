Project: Player Behavior Interpretation

Main Objective:
Develop a system that analyzes NetHack game logs to identify player styles, strengths, and weaknesses. The system will then provide personalized recommendations to improve player performance.

Project Structure

1. Data Collection

 • Game Logs: Utilize NetHack logs (potentially from MiniHack or public servers like alt.org). These logs provide detailed information on player actions. sources: https://alt.org/nethack/top60d.html (list of played games with logs)
 • Sampling: Collect data from both beginner and expert players to capture a variety of styles and skill levels.

2. Data Preprocessing

 • Log Parsing: Analyze logs to extract actions, significant events (e.g., attacks, deaths, item usage), and environmental states.
 • Feature Extraction: Create numerical representations of playstyles:
 • Frequent Actions: Combat, exploration, item usage, retreating.
 • Efficiency: Percentage of goals achieved vs. time or steps taken.
 • Mistakes: Repetitive unnecessary actions or situations leading to death.

3. Playstyle Classification

 • Algorithms: Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to identify groups of players with similar behaviors.
 • Player Categories:
 • Explorers: Prioritize exploration over survival.
 • Fighters: Focus on direct combat.
 • Cautious Players: Minimize risks, paying close attention to the environment.
 • Experimenters: Attempt unconventional actions, often involving intensive item usage.

4. Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses

 • Analyze data to highlight:
 • Strengths: Strategic decisions, smart item usage.
 • Weaknesses: Tendency to enter dangerous situations, poor inventory management, or inability to handle specific enemies.

5. Personalized Suggestions

 • Targeted Recommendations:
 • For a fighter: “Use strategic retreats more often when facing grouped enemies.”
 • For an explorer: “Avoid entering new rooms without preparing an escape strategy.”
 • Improvement Metrics:
 • Survival rate.
 • Exploration efficiency.
 • Reduction in repetitive errors.

6. Output Interface

 • Visualization:
 • Graphs of frequent actions.
 • Heatmaps of visited areas in the game.
 • Report: A PDF or HTML report describing the playstyle, strengths/weaknesses, and recommendations.

Technical Implementation

Required Technologies

 1. Python: For log parsing and analysis.
 2. Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
 3. Scikit-learn: For clustering and classification.
 4. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizations.
 5. Flask/Streamlit (optional): To build an interactive web interface.

Development Stages

 1. Parsing and Preprocessing:
 • Develop a Python script to read logs and transform them into dataframes for analysis.
 2. Data Analysis:
 • Implement clustering and performance metric calculations.
 3. Recommendations:
 • Design rule-based logic or predictive models to provide suggestions.
 4. Visualization:
 • Integrate graphs and reports to display results.

Goals and Challenges

Goals:

 • Enhance the NetHack player experience by making them more aware of their strategic choices.
 • Explore AI to interpret and improve human behavior in complex games.

Challenges:

 • Complexity of NetHack logs and the variability of actions.
 • Interpreting less evident strategies.
 • Scaling the system for very large datasets.

-------------------------------------------------

The project is divided in several steps:
- we have to collect logs of a game (or of a single episode)
- we have to classify data (two approaches: rule-based or Automated NN classifier(Random Forest, clustering K-means))
- we have to analyze data (two approaches: rule-based or Automated NN like llm)

### CLASSIFYING TECHNIQUES DATASET 1
# Techniques for Analyzing NetHack Logs

## 1. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

### Techniques:
- **K-Means**: Suitable for grouping similar playstyles based on numerical features like frequency of actions, inventory usage, or combat tendencies.
- **DBSCAN**: Ideal for detecting less common or unique playstyles, such as "Experimenters" who may try unconventional strategies.

### Why Fit:
These methods help uncover natural groupings in player behavior without requiring labeled data.

## 2. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

### How It Works:
- Models the sequence of actions in the game as states, revealing patterns such as combat followed by healing or exploration sequences.

### Why Fit:
Great for identifying "Cautious Players" (who often follow risk-averse patterns like retreat-heal-repeat) or "Fighters" (who engage enemies directly without fallback strategies).

## 3. Time Series Analysis

### Techniques:
- **Dynamic Time Warping** or **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.

### Why Fit:
Tracks how playstyle evolves over time, identifying changes in behavior such as increased caution after a near-death experience.

## 4. Association Rule Learning

### Techniques:
- **Apriori** or **FP-Growth**.

### Why Fit:
Discovers correlations in inventory usage patterns, such as frequent use of teleportation items by "Experimenters" or healing potions by "Cautious Players."

## Best Fit for This Log

### 1. **Clustering**:
- **Best for exploring natural groupings** of players without predefined labels.
- The log provides ample behavioral data (e.g., attack vs. retreat actions, inventory use) that can feed into clustering algorithms.

### 2. **Random Forests**:
- **Ideal if a labeled dataset is available** (e.g., expert-labeled playstyles).
- The log's richness in features, such as combat stats and item usage, aligns well with the model's needs.

### 3. **Hidden Markov Models**:
- **Excellent for analyzing the sequential nature of gameplay** (e.g., exploring, fighting, healing cycles).
- Fits well with the log's event-driven format.

### 4. **Association Rule Learning**:
- **Useful for mining patterns** like combinations of actions/items that correlate with specific styles.

## Combination Approach

1. **Initial Clustering** to group similar playstyles.
2. Use **Random Forests** with labeled data to refine classifications.
3. Apply **HMMs** to understand sequential behavior in each playstyle.
