# Project: Player Behavior Interpretation for NetHack

The goal of this project is to analyze player behavior within NetHack logs, classify playstyles, identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide personalized recommendations to improve performance. Below is the breakdown of the project structure and the methodologies involved.

---

## Project Structure

### 1. **Data Collection**
- **Game Logs**: The primary source of data will be logs from platforms like **alt.org** or potentially **MiniHack**. These logs provide detailed information on player actions, such as combat, item usage, deaths, and interactions with the environment.
  - **Source**: [alt.org NetHack Logs](https://alt.org/nethack/top60d.html)
- **Sampling**: The data should ideally cover both **beginner and expert players** to ensure a diverse range of player styles and skill levels.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Log Parsing**: Logs will need to be parsed to extract key elements like:
  - **Actions**: Combat, exploration, item usage, death events.
  - **Significant Events**: These include major in-game occurrences like monster encounters, deaths, or the use of critical items.
  - **Environmental States**: Includes game-level data such as dungeon level, player health, and nearby creatures.
  
- **Feature Extraction**: The data should be represented numerically to enable analysis:
  - **Frequent Actions**: This could include things like combat frequency, exploration behaviors, or item usage patterns.
  - **Efficiency**: Measures like the percentage of goals achieved versus time or steps taken in the game.
  - **Mistakes**: Identify repetitive actions, such as repeated deaths due to similar mistakes, or inefficiencies in combat.

### 3. **Playstyle Classification**
- **Clustering Techniques**:
  - **K-Means** or **DBSCAN** could be used to group players based on similar behaviors and actions.
  
- **Player Categories**:
  - **Explorers**: These players prioritize exploration and may often take risks.
  - **Fighters**: Focus on direct combat with little regard for other elements of the game.
  - **Cautious Players**: Focus on minimizing risks, planning strategies, and avoiding danger.
  - **Experimenters**: Players who test unconventional strategies and actions (e.g., heavy use of items).

### 4. **Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses**
- **Strengths**: Strategic decisions, effective item usage, and adaptability in combat or exploration.
- **Weaknesses**: Common mistakes like poor inventory management, tendency to rush into dangerous situations, or poor handling of specific enemies.

### 5. **Personalized Suggestions**
- **For Fighters**: "Consider using strategic retreats more often when facing multiple enemies."
- **For Explorers**: "Avoid entering new rooms without an escape strategy."
- **Improvement Metrics**:
  - **Survival Rate**: How often the player survives encounters and avoids death.
  - **Exploration Efficiency**: Measures how well the player explores the game world.
  - **Reduction in Mistakes**: Reducing unnecessary actions and mistakes that lead to deaths or setbacks.

### 6. **Output Interface**
- **Visualization**:
  - **Frequent Actions**: Graphs showing the most common actions taken by the player.
  - **Heatmaps**: To show areas in the game that the player has explored frequently.
  - **Report**: A summary report (PDF/HTML) detailing the playstyle, strengths, weaknesses, and personalized recommendations.

## Technical Implementation

### **Required Technologies**
- **Python**: For parsing and data analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For manipulating data and performing statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and other classification algorithms.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizations of data such as graphs and heatmaps.
- **Flask/Streamlit** (Optional): To create an interactive web interface for users to upload logs and view analyses.

---

## Development Stages

1. **Parsing and Preprocessing**:
   - Develop a script to read raw logs and convert them into structured formats (e.g., dataframes) for further analysis.
   
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Implement algorithms (e.g., clustering, classification) to identify playstyles and classify the behaviors of different players.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Create rule-based logic or machine learning models to generate personalized suggestions based on the player’s behavior and style.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Integrate visualization tools to display frequent actions, heatmaps of explored areas, and overall reports summarizing the player’s behavior.

## Goals and Challenges

### **Goals**:
- **Enhance the NetHack Player Experience**: Provide players with insights into their strategic choices to help them improve.
- **AI Interpretation of Human Behavior**: Explore how AI can be used to interpret and refine human behavior in complex, interactive environments like NetHack.

### **Challenges**:
- **Log Complexity**: NetHack logs are intricate, containing detailed player actions and events, requiring advanced parsing techniques.
- **Interpreting Strategies**: Some playstyles are subtle, and determining the motivations behind actions (e.g., cautious vs. cowardly behavior) is complex.
- **Scaling**: As the system grows and processes larger datasets, ensuring efficient processing and analysis becomes a challenge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Approaches for Classification and Analysis

- **Classification Approach**:
  1. **Rule-Based**: Manually define criteria for different playstyles (e.g., if a player uses "attack" frequently and has low "retreat" actions, classify as a "Fighter").
  2. **Automated Machine Learning**: Use algorithms like **Random Forests**, **K-Means**, or **Neural Networks** to classify players into groups based on their in-game actions.

- **Analysis Approach**:
  1. **Rule-Based**: Define thresholds for strengths and weaknesses (e.g., excessive healing indicates cautiousness, repetitive deaths suggest a weakness).
  2. **Automated Neural Networks**: Use more sophisticated models like **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** or other sequence-based neural networks to identify patterns over time and predict player behavior.

### CLASSIFYING TECHNIQUES DATASET 1
# Techniques for Analyzing NetHack Logs

## 1. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

### Techniques:
- **K-Means**: Suitable for grouping similar playstyles based on numerical features like frequency of actions, inventory usage, or combat tendencies.
- **DBSCAN**: Ideal for detecting less common or unique playstyles, such as "Experimenters" who may try unconventional strategies.

### Why Fit:
These methods help uncover natural groupings in player behavior without requiring labeled data.

## 2. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

### How It Works:
- Models the sequence of actions in the game as states, revealing patterns such as combat followed by healing or exploration sequences.

### Why Fit:
Great for identifying "Cautious Players" (who often follow risk-averse patterns like retreat-heal-repeat) or "Fighters" (who engage enemies directly without fallback strategies).

## 3. Time Series Analysis

### Techniques:
- **Dynamic Time Warping** or **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.

### Why Fit:
Tracks how playstyle evolves over time, identifying changes in behavior such as increased caution after a near-death experience.

## 4. Association Rule Learning

### Techniques:
- **Apriori** or **FP-Growth**.

### Why Fit:
Discovers correlations in inventory usage patterns, such as frequent use of teleportation items by "Experimenters" or healing potions by "Cautious Players."

## Best Fit for This Log

### 1. **Clustering**:
- **Best for exploring natural groupings** of players without predefined labels.
- The log provides ample behavioral data (e.g., attack vs. retreat actions, inventory use) that can feed into clustering algorithms.

### 2. **Random Forests**:
- **Ideal if a labeled dataset is available** (e.g., expert-labeled playstyles).
- The log's richness in features, such as combat stats and item usage, aligns well with the model's needs.

### 3. **Hidden Markov Models**:
- **Excellent for analyzing the sequential nature of gameplay** (e.g., exploring, fighting, healing cycles).
- Fits well with the log's event-driven format.

### 4. **Association Rule Learning**:
- **Useful for mining patterns** like combinations of actions/items that correlate with specific styles.

## Combination Approach

1. **Initial Clustering** to group similar playstyles.
2. Use **Random Forests** with labeled data to refine classifications.
3. Apply **HMMs** to understand sequential behavior in each playstyle.
