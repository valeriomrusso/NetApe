# AIF Project: Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## Overview
This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course for the Master's degree in AI and Computer Science at the University of Pisa. It focuses on implementing and experimenting with different AI algorithms, specifically within the context of the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE).

## Setup Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Create the Environment
Ensure that you have the necessary environment set up by following the steps in the `HowToMinihack.md` file. This document will guide you through the installation of required dependencies and environment setup for seamless execution of the project.

### 2. Running the Code
Once your environment is ready, execute the following steps:

- Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Basecode_NetApe.ipynb`.
- To test a specific algorithm, locate the line in the notebook where the algorithm is defined (usually marked with a comment).
- Uncomment that line to activate the algorithm and run only the final block of the notebook to observe the results.

### 3. Experimentation
Feel free to modify parameters, adjust the code, or test different algorithms to explore various aspects of the project.
